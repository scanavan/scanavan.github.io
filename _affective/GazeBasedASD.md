# Abstract
People with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) display impairments in social interaction and communication skills, as well as restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, which greatly affect daily life functioning. Current identification of ASD involves a lengthy process that requires an experienced clinician to
assess multiple domains of functioning. Considering this, we propose a method for classifying multiple
levels of risk of ASD using eye gaze and demographic feature descriptors such as a subject’s age and gender. We construct feature descriptors that incorporate the subject’s age and gender, as well as features
based on eye gaze patterns. We also present an analysis of eye gaze patterns validating the use of the
selected hand-crafted features. We assess the efficacy of our descriptors to classify ASD on a National
Database for Autism Research dataset, using multiple classifiers including a random forest, C4.5 decision
tree, PART, and a deep feedforward neural network.
