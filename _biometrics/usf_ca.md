Welcome! This dataset contains non-posed emotion data sequences for 27 subjects. Each subject id begins with PXXXX. In order to evoke a range of emotions in a lab environment, each participant watches 4 different videos for a total of 3 times. The videos were acquired using sony 4k camcorder and were compressed to a resolution of 640x480. There are also multiple physiological signals acquired during the session using an [E4 Empatica](https://www.empatica.com/research/e4/) watch. The signals include - Heart rate (HR), Temperature (TEMP), 3D accelerometer (ACC) and Electrodermal activity (EDA). Additionally, it also has the facial features extracted from each video using the [Openface 2.0](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace) software. More description about this dataset can be found in the [paper](/files/IJCB.pdf) published at IJCB 2023. Please contact [Dr. Shaun Canavan](mailto:scanavan@usf.edu) to request the USF CA dataset.
